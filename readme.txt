Easily post syntax-highlighted code to your site without having to modify the code at all. Compatible with AMP pages.

== Description ==

*With support for the new block editor in WordPress 5.0!*

SyntaxHighlighter Amplified allows you to easily post syntax-highlighted code to your site without losing its formatting or making any manual changes. It uses the [highlight.php package by Geert Bergman](https://github.com/scrivo/highlight.php) to render code on the server-side so it has no depedencies on extrenal Javascript libraries thus is compatible with AMP pages.
